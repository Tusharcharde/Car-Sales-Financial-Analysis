# Car-Sales-Financial-Analysis Dashboard – My Power BI Project

As part of my data analytics journey, I created an interactive dashboard in Power BI using a dataset of over 547,000 used car sales across the U.S. The goal was to explore and understand trends in car pricing, buyer behavior, and market preferences.

What I Did :
I started with data cleaning in Power BI — handling missing values, converting date fields to months, ensuring correct data types, and creating calculated measures like:

Total number of cars sold

Minimum and maximum selling prices

Total number of unique car makes

Average price by car condition

Once the data was prepared, I designed a two-page dashboard that could dynamically filter by month, car body, state, and year.

What I Built :
Page 1: Sales Overview
KPIs: Total cars (547K), total car brands (64), price range ($1 to $230K)

Month slicer: Allows users to explore seasonal patterns

Top Buyer States: Texas leads with 45K purchases, followed by Tennessee and Virginia

Top Selling Brands: Toyota dominates with 39K cars sold

Top 5 Car Colors: White (46%), Silver, and Red were most popular

Page 2: Deeper Analysis
Avg. Selling Price by Condition: Higher-rated cars (Condition 5.0) sell for more, averaging around $25K

Transmission Type Breakdown: Automatic cars make up 85% of sales

Body Types: Sedans and SUVs lead, with sedans alone accounting for nearly 237K units

Map View: Shows state-wise preference for body types

Year Slider: Enables filtering by car manufacturing year (1982–2015)

Insights & Findings :
Toyota is the most popular car make by a large margin, showing strong consumer trust and resale value.

White and silver cars are preferred colors, likely due to their neutral look and resale appeal.

Automatic transmissions dominate the market, indicating consumer preference for ease of driving.

Texas leads the buyer count by a large margin, suggesting a high demand in that region.

Condition matters: There's a clear upward trend in selling price as vehicle condition improves.

Sedans and SUVs continue to be the go-to body types for most buyers.

Luxury cars with higher price points still sell, but in much smaller quantities, reflecting niche demand.

Why I Built This :
I wanted to create something that wasn’t just visually engaging but also practical and informative. This dashboard helps:

Dealerships identify high-demand makes and colors

Buyers benchmark car prices based on condition and features

Analysts and stakeholders monitor market trends over time

It’s interactive, insightful, and user-friendly — everything a good data product should be
